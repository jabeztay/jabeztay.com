## Website

Notes of the stuff I've learnt and done. My personal notes are a complete mess as I'm just taking them as I go, here's my attempt to organise them and clean up.

Most of the content here will be about cybersecurity, notes and references to things while learning, or doing CTFs.

## Personal

I'm Jabez. I previously worked as a data engineer and currently work in cybersecurity.

I've mostly learned through using online resources, and on the job itself. I'd like to think I'm pretty quick on picking up new things, but also know there are many others way ahead of me.

## Acknowledgements

I try to attribute all the resources I've used to build up my notes here. If you feel I've not properly attributed something to you or another resource, please reach out to me or feel free to open an issue on my [repo](https://github.com/jabeztay/jabeztay.com).
